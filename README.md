  <!-- Usability Considerations -->
    - NavBar page links are changed for each page. E.g. When user is in Bio page, Bio page link in Nav Bar will have a different border     design from other page links in the NavBar. This will make it easier for user to know which page they are currently in now.
    - Font sizes are adjusted when width of windows is adjusted.
    - Contact Links are situated in the side bar to allow for easier access.

<!-- Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words) -->
  Top level domains (.com etc.) was introduced in 1984. In 1982 the TCP/IP was standardized. TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet. It identified how data should be broken into packets, transmitted and received at the right destination. In 1984 the DNS is established, it allowed domain names to be matched to the IP address. In 1990, the first web browser WorldWideWeb is developed by Tim Berners Lee. 

<!-- Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words) -->
  When a URL is typed into the web browser, the browser goes to the DNS which is an address book for websites (matches name of website to a particular IP address) to find the IP address of the website. The browser sends a request to the web server asking for a copy of the website and if the server approves of the request it sends a 200 OK message and starts sending the website's files (HTML and assets) to the browser. The browser then puts together the small chunks of data that the server sends and displays the website.


<!-- Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words) -->
  Internet development has allowed for better accessibility. Information and knowledge can be communicated with a greater population in a short amount of time. In daily lives, internet has allowed the world to be more informed of current news and events. 
  For example, internet development has benefited the medical profession significantly. Recently a doctor performed a remote brain surgery on a patient 3000km away. This would mean that internet could help allow people in remote areas to get access to the best healthcare as doctors would not need to be on-site and can attend to patients in need that are far away.
